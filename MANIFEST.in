# setuptools should no longer need a MANIFEST.in file, but sadly when paired with the
# setuptools-scm plugin and specifically in a scenario where the fallback_version string needs to
# be applied setuptools doesn't properly exercise its default package discovery behaviour leading
# to empty installations, that's where this MANIFEST.in hack comes in and makes sure that our
# project is properly installed inside the container image environment on this rare occasion.
