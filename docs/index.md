# Cachi2

Cachi2 is a CLI tool that pre-fetches your project's dependencies to support hermetic, reproducible,
and secure builds. It only fetches explicitly declared dependencies to help you maintain an
auditable manifest of all build inputs while preventing accidental reliance on external network
resources. Furthermore, Cachi2 generates an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for your project as a
byproduct of its operation.
